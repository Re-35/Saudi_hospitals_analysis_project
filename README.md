# Project: Hospital data analysis

Analysis dataset about respiratory diseases conditions in Saudi hospitals in 2020-2024.

## 🔍 Overview

After finished Data Analysis part in "Data Analysis and AI" path at satr.com, I passionated to applying what I learned,
I choosed 'Health care' majore, and find dataset related to our health ministry in Kaggel, after saw if the dataset is what I want
I asking myself two questions: 
- What unusual patterns I want to see?
- How apply what I learned at this project?

## 📊 Features

- Data exploring.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Visual analysis with Seaborn, costomize the figures by Matplotlib.
- Insights gotten from graphs.

## 🧠 Conclusion

Throughout this exploratory analysis, I got several insights that are:

- Patients with higher severity levels tend to have longer average stays.
- Seasonal patterns may influence hospitalization frequency, especially during the summer and spring, which was too different to what thought
  at the first time.
- 'Asthma' disease is more infected to patients than other respiratory diseases.
- Male are more susceptible to infection than Female, and ( 18 - 45 ) age group are more susceptible to infection than others also.

These insights can support hospital resource planning and patient risk stratification.  
Future steps may include building a predictive model for stay duration based on early indicators like age, severity, and visit count.

This project marks a solid foundation in healthcare data analysis and opens room for deeper exploration, now it has more and clear
chances to analysis the data in more specific way or focused on specific columns.

## 💻 How to Test

1. Save the notebook in your computer.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyte.
3. Run all cells.

If don't want to run the notebook you can just see the codes in PDF notebook I uplouded.

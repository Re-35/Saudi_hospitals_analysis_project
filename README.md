# Project: Hospital Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis of respiratory disease cases in Saudi hospitals (2020–2024).

## 🔍 Overview

After completing the Data Analysis module in the “Data Analysis and AI” path on satr.com, I was eager to apply what I had learned in real dataset. I chose the **healthcare** sector and found a related dataset from the Saudi Ministry of Health on **Kaggle**. I asked myself two key questions:

- What unusual patterns can be discovered in the data?
- How can I apply my new skills effectively?

## 📊 Features

- Data exploration and cleaning  
- Preprocessing of missing and categorical values  
- Visual analysis using **Seaborn** and custom **Matplotlib** settings  
- Extraction of insights from data visualizations  

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Patients with higher severity levels tend to have longer hospital stays  
- Seasonal patterns affect admission rates — spring and summer showed unexpected spikes  
- **Asthma** is the most common respiratory condition in the dataset  
- **Males** are more frequently affected than females  
- The age group **18–45** is the most impacted across conditions  

These findings can help in **hospital resource planning** and **patient risk stratification**. Future steps may include developing predictive models based on severity, age, and admission history.

## 💻 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the `.ipynb` notebook using **Jupyter Notebook**  
3. Run all cells to view the full analysis  
4. Alternatively, refer to the attached PDF for a read-only version
